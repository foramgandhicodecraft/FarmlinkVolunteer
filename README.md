# Farmlink Volunteer Project: Donor Engagement Dashboard

## Overview
This project showcases my volunteer work with Farmlink, a non-profit organization focused on food sustainability. Using Python, I developed a tool to enhance donor engagement by integrating with the MailChimp API and creating an interactive dashboard for donor data visualization.

## Key Features
- **MailChimp Integration:** Connected to the MailChimp API to retrieve donor email activity data.
- **Data Collection:** Downloaded and processed donor and donation data using Python scripts.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Combined data sources to create an interactive dashboard using PowerBI, providing insights into donor behavior and engagement.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Focus on pandas for data manipulation)
- MailChimp API

## How to Use
1. **Setup Environment:** Clone the repository and set up the Python environment with necessary dependencies.
2. **API Credentials:** Obtain MailChimp API credentials and configure them in the project.
3. **Data Extraction:** Run Python scripts to extract donor email activity and donation data.
4. **Dashboard:** Launch the interactive dashboard to explore donor insights and engagement metrics.
